# Beesides - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Beesides is a community-driven music discovery platform that helps users find their next favorite albums through people, not algorithms. The platform creates a space for music enthusiasts to rate, review, collect, and share music, breaking the algorithmic loop that keeps users listening to the same types of music. Beesides focuses on album-centric experiences and human curation, helping users expand their musical horizons through genuine recommendations from real people with similar tastes.

## Problem Statement

Current music streaming platforms face several limitations:

1. Algorithm-driven recommendations create a feedback loop, suggesting the same type of music and limiting discovery
2. No comprehensive way to document music journeys and build a personal music identity
3. Limited community engagement around music discussions and recommendations
4. Lack of album-focused experiences in platforms that prioritize individual tracks and playlists

## Target Users

- Music Enthusiasts: People passionate about music discovery who want to find new artists and albums
- Album Collectors: Users who appreciate the album format and want to catalog their collections
- Tastemakers: Music connoisseurs who enjoy sharing recommendations and building reputation
- Casual Listeners: Users tired of algorithm recommendations who want to discover new music

## User Experience Goals

- Enable authentic music discovery through human-curated recommendations
